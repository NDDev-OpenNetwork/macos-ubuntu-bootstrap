"""Prove CI analyses this repository with the tools its contract pins.

`config/rldyour-contract.json` states which version and digest of a tool a
device gets. Several of those tools -- the CI-parity scanners -- are also run by
this repository's own workflows, through reusable workflows that carry their own
defaults. Nothing compared the two, and they had diverged: the contract pinned
OSV-Scanner 2.5.0 while the caller passed no version at all and inherited the
provider's 2.4.0 default, whose scanning pipeline is not the same one. A
developer's machine and the repository's merge gate were answering the same
question with different programs.

The check that used to guard this searched the installers for variable names:

    for marker in ("RLDYOUR_CODEX_VERSION", "RLDYOUR_CODEX_SHA512", ...):
        if marker not in common_data: raise SystemExit(...)

A name is not an identity. Every one of those markers survives changing the
version it holds, the digest it holds and the URL it is fetched from, which is
the entire content of a dependency pin. This module compares the values.

Three properties, each of which fails on a real mutation:

1. every tool a workflow acquires by version and digest matches the contract;
2. every download inside a workflow is bound to a fixed version in its URL and
   verified against a digest before it is used;
3. no vendor installer is executed straight from the network, and the pins that
   make that safe hold their declared shape.
